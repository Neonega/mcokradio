	<w style="padding-left: 12px;">Families - sometimes you love them, sometimes you bicker with them, and sometimes you marry them off to consolidate your power in Europe. Welcome to a look at some of history’s most fearsome families.</w>

    <w>In this episode, Fred Sirieix is on hand as Queen Victoria makes several trips to the Historical First Dates restaurant, in a bid to marry off her children for love, and definitely not to consolidate her empire. Elsewhere, Leopold Mozart is lovingly retiring his 18-year-old daughter Maria Anna from performing in public, in favour of bringing little Wolfgang into the spotlight, and Henry VIII’s children Elizabeth, Mary and Edward are engaging in a regal game of 'Your Mum'.</w>
    
    <w>Paulina Pepys is grateful for the help from her brother Samuel when he offers to put her up in his home, right up until the point at which she discovers she is actually graciously being given a roof over her head in return for becoming one of his servants - and she is very much starting at the bottom of the servant scale.</w>
    
    <w>In Made In Macedonia, Alexander the Great can’t quite work out why people who stand in the way of his advancement keep mysteriously dying, and his mum, Olympias, is completely in the dark about it too.</w>
    
    <w>Meanwhile, we take a look at what Puritan children did for fun as they head down to ‘fun’ theme park 'Puritown’, we see what happened back at home for Viking families when the male Vikings went away pillaging for months, and the Bronte sisters tell us about their triumph over adversity. Brother Branwell tries to get in on the act, too, but it seems that no-one really listens to him.</w>
